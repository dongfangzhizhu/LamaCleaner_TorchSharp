# LamaCleaner_TorchSharp

## Project Overview

**LamaCleaner_TorchSharp** is a project designed to explore the potential of AI development on the .NET Core platform. Based on [TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp), this project focuses on porting the Python implementation of the **Lama Cleaner** model to the .NET Core environment. Lama Cleaner is an open-source watermark removal tool built on PyTorch.

## Features

- **Model Compatibility**: Supports automatic loading of pre-trained models by specifying the weight file path during initialization.
- **.NET Core Integration**: Leverages the cross-platform capabilities of .NET Core to expand the boundaries of AI application development.

## Dependencies

- [TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp): .NET bindings for PyTorch, providing deep learning functionalities.

## Installation & Execution

Please refer to the `INSTALL.md` file for detailed installation instructions and environment configuration guidance. After cloning the repository, ensure all dependencies are properly installed and follow the setup steps for the .NET Core environment.
